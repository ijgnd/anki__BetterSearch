The main functionality of this addon is to show filter dialogs when you type "tag:", "deck:", "xx:" etc. To
close such a dialog just press "Esc".

The Anking made two videos that among other things show older versions of 
this addon. Though a few things have changed in my addon they're still a very useful introduction
to my addon. Watch [Anki: Better Searching Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlcsNIsYc7k) 
and [Anki: How to Find Cards and Tags in the Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpl-j9pULU).

Most of the settings are not relevant for regular users. You'll find the settings mentioned in
the Anking videos below in the sections "browser shortcuts" and "custom search operators for 
custom filter dialogs" and "open filter dialog after typing these search operators".

Override keys are no longer working in this version. Also some config options from old versions were removed. 
I removed the functionality to just insert the current text from the filter dialog: Just use 
Ctrl+A,Ctrl+C,Esc,Ctrl+V. I also removed the functionality to add a star at the end, just edit the 
inserted string after closing the dialog. Those features were hardly used based on reports I got.
Whether closing the dialog triggers a search can now only be set in the lower left of each filter
dialog by using a checkbox.

If you post somewhere else (like a new thread, addon rating, etc.) I won't be notified and I will miss your report.
