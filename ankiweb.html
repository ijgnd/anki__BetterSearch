With this add-on when you type "tag:", "deck:", "note:", or "card:" into the browser search bar a dialog opens that allows you to filter and insert a matching tag/deck/notetype name/cardtype name into the search bar. There's also a dialog that puts tags and decknames into one selection dialog. This latter option might be useful if you have many tags and many subdecks. By default this dialog is opened by typing in "all:" or "xx". In the add-on config you can disable the filter dialog for each search tag and set custom strings for the merged deck/tag dialog.

There are also shortcuts that open the filter dialogs directly (that you can adjust in the config). By default a filter dialog that was opened by a shortcut runs the search. You can adjust this in the config and temporarily override this by pressing shift when you close the filter dialog.
