With this add-on when you type "tag:", "deck:", "note:", or "card:" into the browser search bar a dialog opens that allows you to filter and insert a matching tag/deck/notetype name/cardtype name into the search bar. 

This add-on also adds two special filter dialogs:

- If you type in "all:" or "xx"  a dialog opens that contains tags and decknames in one selection dialog. This might might be useful if you have many tags and many subdecks. This is inspired by the search on ankimobile.
- if you type in "cfn:" a dialog opens where you can select a card of a certain note type so that you'll e.g. get <code>("card:Card 2" and "note:Basic (optional reversed card)")</code>. "cfn" stands for "card from note". This feature was added in 2020-04.

There are also shortcuts that open the filter dialogs directly (that you can adjust in the config), e.g. "Ctrl+H, T" opens the tag filer dialog in the browser even if the focus is not in the search box. 

By default a filter dialog that was opened by a shortcut runs the search. You can adjust this in the config and temporarily override this by pressing shift when you close the filter dialog. 

In the dialog you can go down with the down arrow or Ctrl+N and go up with the up arrow or Ctrl+H or Ctrl+P.

This addon also works in the "Create Filtered Decks" window.
