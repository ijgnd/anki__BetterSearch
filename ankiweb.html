This add-on used to be named <b>Browser Search Box: Quick Insert Tag, Deck, Notetype</b>. I think the new name is more catchy and fits better this new version with more features.

This add-on offers multiple search-related enhancements.

<b>1. additional filter dialogs</b>
With this add-on when you type "tag:", "deck:", "note:", or "card:", etc. into the browser search bar a dialog opens that allows you to filter and insert a matching tag, deck, notetype, cardtype, etc. into the search bar. See the gif above.

<b>2. option to move the search bar in the browser so that it gets wider</b>
In Anki versions 2.1.40 or lower you can also move the search bar in the browser down so that it's wider or that it contains multiple lines, see the image below. To change the search bar position you must adjust the add-on setting "-Modify Search Bar" from "false" to either "down" or "multiline". When you use the setting "multiline" you'll see two additional buttons which I highlighted in blue below. "History" replaces the drop-down menu that you usually have at the right side of the search bar. "FF" allows you to open the filter dialogs with your mouse.

<b>3. extra multiline dialog for your search term with helper buttons</b>
You can also view the current search term in an extra dialog where it can be split up into multiple lines. This is e.g. useful if you want to search for a term only in certain decks and only if the note has some tag and you have long deck names and long tag names. See the screenshot below. In this dialog you have some buttons which allow you to add filters without having to remember the exact terms Anki uses. By default with the "multiline" setting a search is automatically run whenever you type a space or enter.
In the following screenshot in the bottom dialog there's a button "Filter".  This is only available in Anki versions 2.1.26 or later.

<b>4. extra dialog to narrow your search by date added/rated/edited</b>
There's also a custom dialog to make it easier to narrow your searches by date. In Anki you can limit your search by "date added" and "date rated" and since 2.1.28 by "date edited". But you can only search relative to today's date, e.g. to find cards rated on or after yesterday you would type in "rated:2". This gets less useful if you e.g. want so search for notes added during the first week of the semester which was from April, 15th to April, 19th ... For these cases this add-on offers a dialog where you can select absolute dates (like April, 15th) and the add-on will transform them so that Anki understands them.

<b># other add-ons</b>
The add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1135507717" rel="nofollow">Extended Tag Add/Edit Dialog</a> lets you use filter dialogs (as shown in the first screencast on top of this page) to insert tags into a note in the editor (in the Add Window, at the bottom of the Browser or in the Edit Current window).

<b># Details</b>
For a full description read the info text on the right side of the add-on config dialog inside Anki. You can also view this configâ€‹.md file <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__BetterSearch/blob/master/src/config.md" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

The default shortcut to open the multi-line dialog is "Ctrl+t, s". You press "Ctrl+t", then release both keys and then press "s". On MacOS instead of "Ctrl+t" you use "Cmd+t". My mnemonic is "<i>t</i>o <i>s</i>earch".

BetterSearch also adds some special filter dialogs:
- If you type in "all:" or "xx"  a dialog opens that contains tags and decknames in one selection dialog. This might might be useful if you have many tags and many subdecks. This is inspired by the search on ankimobile.
- if you type in "cfn:" a dialog opens where you can select a card of a certain note type so that you'll e.g. get <code>("card:Card 2" and "note:Basic (optional reversed card)")</code>. "cfn" stands for "card from note".
- there's a similar "ffn" (field from note) dialog.

There are also shortcuts that open the filter dialogs directly (that you can adjust in the config), e.g. "Ctrl+H, T" opens the tag filer dialog in the browser even if the focus is not in the search box. 

By default a filter dialog that was opened by a shortcut runs the search. You can adjust this in the config and temporarily override this by pressing shift when you close the filter dialog. 

In the dialog you can go down with the down arrow or Ctrl+N and go up with the up arrow or Ctrl+H or Ctrl+P.

This addon also works in the "Create Filtered Decks" window.
