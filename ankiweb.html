This add-on offers multiple search-related enhancements.

<b>1. additional filter dialogs</b>
With this add-on when you type "tag:", "deck:", "note:", or "card:", etc. into the browser search bar a dialog opens that allows you to filter and insert a matching tag, deck, notetype, cardtype, etc. into the search bar. See the gif above.

<b>2. extra dialog to narrow your search by date added/rated/edited</b>
There's also a custom dialog to make it easier to narrow your searches by date. In Anki you can limit your search by "date added" and "date rated" and since 2.1.28 by "date edited". But you can only search relative to today's date, e.g. to find cards rated on or after yesterday you would type in "rated:2". This gets less useful if you e.g. want so search for notes added during the first week of the semester which was from April, 15th to April, 19th ... For these cases this add-on offers a dialog where you can select absolute dates (like April, 15th) and the add-on will transform them so that Anki understands them.

For older Anki versions (2.1.40 from 2021-02 or older) you could also adjust the position in the of the search bar in the browser and which buttons were shown around it. Anki 2.1.41 removed all buttons around the searchbar so my functionality is not really needed anymore.

<b># other add-ons</b>
The add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1135507717" rel="nofollow">Extended Tag Add/Edit Dialog</a> lets you use filter dialogs (as shown in the first screencast on top of this page) to insert tags into a note in the editor (in the Add Window, at the bottom of the Browser or in the Edit Current window).

<b># Details</b>
For a full description read the info text on the right side of the add-on config dialog inside Anki. You can also view this configâ€‹.md file <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__BetterSearch/blob/master/src/config.md" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The config may contain settings that are no longer relevant on more recent Anki versions.

The default shortcut to open the multi-line dialog is "Ctrl+t, s". You press "Ctrl+t", then release both keys and then press "s". On MacOS instead of "Ctrl+t" you use "Cmd+t". My mnemonic is "<i>t</i>o <i>s</i>earch".

BetterSearch also adds some special filter dialogs:
- If you type in "all:" or "xx"  a dialog opens that contains tags and decknames in one selection dialog. This might might be useful if you have many tags and many subdecks. This is inspired by the search on ankimobile.
- if you type in "cfn:" a dialog opens where you can select a card of a certain note type so that you'll e.g. get <code>("card:Card 2" and "note:Basic (optional reversed card)")</code>. "cfn" stands for "card from note".
- there's a similar "ffn" (field from note) dialog.

There are also shortcuts that open the filter dialogs directly (that you can adjust in the config), e.g. "Ctrl+H, T" opens the tag filer dialog in the browser even if the focus is not in the search box. 

By default a filter dialog that was opened by a shortcut runs the search. You can adjust this in the config and temporarily override this by pressing shift when you close the filter dialog. 

In the dialog you can go down with the down arrow or Ctrl+N and go up with the up arrow or Ctrl+H or Ctrl+P.

This addon also works in the "Create Filtered Decks" window.
